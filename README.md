## Troubleshooting and advises

In order to work comfortably, TDK requires at least 2-4 GB of memory.

So check the memory settings for your Docker:
- in case of Docker Desktop ([windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/windows), [mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac))
- in case of [classical](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints) Docker
